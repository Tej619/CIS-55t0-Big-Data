For programming assignment 1, the Google Colab platform has been used.

Logic and Observations:

1. Import the required PySpark libraries and the 'Sample.txt' file as the input file from google drive I have used gdown libraby instead of wget command.

2. In the following problem statement, I assumed that six-word sequences will not contain punctuation so removed the punctations with replaced that space using regular expression and made all the words as lower cases. Created the function 'six_word_sequence()' which takes the parameter 'line' as one line at a time from the 'Sample.txt' file. The function finally returns six-word sequences using '.join()' inside a list. While using join and looping through words, the last 5 words are neglected from the total length of words, as after the last six-word-sequence its not possible to get a six-word-sequence using 5 words.

3. The 'flatMap()' function is used for flattening and generating six-word sequences using a lambda function which returns results from the 'six_word_sequence()' function.

4. After this, each sequence is mapped to count 1 using the 'map()' function followed by the 'reduceByKey()' function for grouping common six-word sequences and adding their count. 

5. Results are stored in descending order with max no of count of six-word sequenece. To check the desired the output I just print top 20 elements. The final results are stored in distributed manner in multiple part files.
